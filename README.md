# Must-Read AI papers
A collections of must-read AI-related papers.

Disclaimer: the list is totally opinion-based. Moreover, my list does not mean "you should read X and should not read Y", and may or may not contain popular papers. In this list, I list papers I think that are important in AI (and maybe other topics). Usually they are tips and tricks, and not-so-well-known papers. I also do not promote any paper.

## List (In no order)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560): an important paper in RL. It compares algorithms using multiple seeds (I mean, *multiple*), and gives advices how to conduct RL research and experiments.
- [How Many Random Seeds? Statistical Power Analysis in Deep Reinforcement Learning Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08295): how many seeds you use to express statistical significance? 5? 10? 20? This paper explains why, from a statistical view.
- [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864): a rotary positional encoding technique that researchers at EleutherAI found a (significant improvement in performance)[https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/].
- [On the Origin of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07800): ever wonder when DL emerges? This one got you covered!
- [Co-Mixup: Saliency Guided Joint Mixup with Supermodular Diversity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gvxJzw8kW4b): a novel mix-up technique that creates new data in batches instead of a pair of images.
- [Combining Ensembles and Data Augmentation Can Harm Your Calibration](https://openreview.net/forum?id=g11CZSghXyY): experiments show that combining ensembles and augmentations can decrease your performance.
- [What Matters In On-Policy Reinforcement Learning? A Large-Scale Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05990): advices about how to choose hyperparameters for PPO on continuous control task.
- [Action Space Shaping in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00980): how to shape your action space? Should it `(1, 6)` or `(2, 3)`?
- [BOLA: Near-Optimal Bitrate Adaptation for Online Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06748.pdf): determine the near-optimal video quality based on your network speed!
